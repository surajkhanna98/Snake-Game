# Reinforcement Learning Snake Game AI

This project is a demonstration of how an AI model can be trained using reinforcement learning to play the classic game of Snake and achieve the highest possible score.
Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this project:

    Python 3.8
    Pygame Library
    TensorFlow 2.4.1
    Keras 2.4.3

To run this project, you will need the following:

    Python 3.8 or later
    Pygame Library
    TensorFlow 2.4.1
    Keras 2.4.3


To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python snakeai.py
```
This will start the Snake game, and the AI model will start training. You can watch the game and observe how the AI model learns to play the game and achieves higher scores with each iteration.
